### Trip Analysis

* There are far more non-subscribers than subscribers, and they travel far longer. 
* Majority of subscribers are of age 11-50 range, where as non-subscribers tend to range from 31-70. 
* There are a lot of customers who don't use their real age, and hence we see age ranges from 0-10 and 100+
* Women tend to be greater riders than men, however we do not know the gender of majority of our customers.

### Hour by Hour Analysis

- We see the least amount of activity from 4 AM to 9 AM. 
- The most amount of activity is during the afternoon hours, and during the evening hours. 
- Surprisingly, there is a lot of activity between the hours of midnight and 3 AM. 

The hour by hour report indicates that the New York city is truly the city that never sleeps. Bikes are rented at late nights and all throughout the day. Surprisingly, the hours of 5/6PM has the least amount of usage for a given set of "rush hours".
